## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an **intermediate developer** focused on **Flutter (mobile app development)** and **Data Science / Machine Learning**.  
I enjoy building small, complete cross-platform apps and experimenting with data pipelines and models — balancing **user experience** with **data-driven features**.

I value:
- clarity over cleverness  
- progress over perfection  
- consistency over streaks

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Building clean, responsive Flutter apps with modern state management (Riverpod / Provider / BLoC)
- Practicing ML workflows: data cleaning, feature engineering, model tuning, and deployment
- Bridging mobile + ML: on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite) and backend model APIs

---

## 🌱 I’m Learning
- Advanced Flutter patterns, custom animations, and performance profiling
- End-to-end Data Science: EDA → modelling → deployment (FastAPI, Docker)
- Model interpretability, MLOps basics, and experiment tracking

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

**Mobile**
- Flutter / Dart • Widgets, Layouts, State Management, Animations

**Data & ML**
- Python • pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- TensorFlow, PyTorch (experimentation level)

**Backend & Infra**
- FastAPI, REST APIs, Firebase (Auth / Firestore)
- Docker, Git, GitHub Actions

**Testing**
- Flutter widget & unit tests  
- Model validation & cross-validation

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **flutter-notes** — Notes app with clean UI, local DB, and sync concepts  
- **ds-experiments** — EDA notebooks, baselines, and visualizations  
- **ml-deploy-demo** — ML model served with FastAPI + Docker, mobile client demo

## 🧭 Growth Roadmap

### 🔹 Now
- Strengthening Flutter foundations and architecture
- Building small but complete ML pipelines
- Writing clearer READMEs and documenting learning

### 🔹 Next
- Production-ready Flutter apps with Firebase & APIs
- Deploying ML models users can interact with
- Improving testing and CI/CD confidence

### 🔹 Later
- Advanced ML systems & MLOps
- High-impact mobile products
- Mentoring and open-source contributions

<sub>Focused on the long game.</sub>

## 📜 My Developer Manifesto

- Write code I can understand six months later  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Build things that teach me something new  
- Measure growth by depth, not noise  
- Stay curious, even when it’s hard  

---

## 🌱 Learning in Public

I believe in sharing progress — even when it’s messy.

That includes:
- small commits  
- experimental notebooks  
- refactors  
- lessons learned the hard way  

All of it counts.

---

## ⏳ My Weekly Rhythm
- 🧠 Learn something new  
- 🧪 Try it in a small experiment  
- ✍️ Document what worked (and what didn’t)  
- 🔁 Improve an older project  

<sub>Consistency is returning — not never missing.</sub>
