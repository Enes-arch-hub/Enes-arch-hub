# Hi there 👋 I'm Enes Mumeita || Software Engineer

<!-- last-updated --> Updated on 2025-11-29

I'm an intermediate learner focused on Flutter (mobile app development) and Data Science (ML, data wrangling, visualization). I build small cross-platform apps and experiment with data pipelines and models — balancing app UX and data-driven features.

## 🔭 Current focus
- Building clean, responsive Flutter apps with modern state management (Riverpod / Provider / BLoC).
- Practicing ML workflows: data cleaning, feature engineering, model tuning, and deployment.
- Bridging mobile + ML: on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite) and backend model APIs.

## 🌱 I’m learning
- Advanced Flutter patterns, custom animations, and performance profiling.
- End-to-end Data Science: exploratory analysis -> modelling -> deployment (Docker, FastAPI).
- Model interpretability, MLOps basics, and experiment tracking.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- Flutter / Dart • Widgets, Layouts, State Management, Animations
- Python • pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- ML frameworks • TensorFlow, PyTorch (experimentation level)
- Data tools • Jupyter / Colab, SQL, preprocessing pipelines
- Dev & infra • Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, REST APIs, Firebase (Auth/Firestore)
- Testing • widget/unit tests (Flutter), model validation & cross-validation
