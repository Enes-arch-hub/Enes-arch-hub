# Hi there 👋 I'm Enes Mumeita 

<!-- last-updated --> Updated on 2025-11-29

I'm an intermediate learner focused on Flutter (mobile app development) and Data Science (ML, data wrangling, visualization). I build small cross-platform apps and experiment with data pipelines and models — balancing app UX and data-driven features.

## 🔭 Current focus
- Building clean, responsive Flutter apps with modern state management (Riverpod / Provider / BLoC).
- Practicing ML workflows: data cleaning, feature engineering, model tuning, and deployment.
- Bridging mobile + ML: on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite) and backend model APIs.

## 🌱 I’m learning
- Advanced Flutter patterns, custom animations, and performance profiling.
- End-to-end Data Science: exploratory analysis -> modelling -> deployment (Docker, FastAPI).
- Model interpretability, MLOps basics, and experiment tracking.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- Flutter / Dart • Widgets, Layouts, State Management, Animations
- Python • pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- ML frameworks • TensorFlow, PyTorch (experimentation level)
- Data tools • Jupyter / Colab, SQL, preprocessing pipelines
- Dev & infra • Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, REST APIs, Firebase (Auth/Firestore)
- Testing • widget/unit tests (Flutter), model validation & cross-validation

## 🚀 Featured projects (add, update, and pin your repos)
- [flutter-notes](https://github.com/Enes-arch-hub/flutter-notes) — Notes app with local DB, syncing example and clean UI.
- [ds-experiments](https://github.com/Enes-arch-hub/ds-experiments) — Collection of notebooks: EDA, model baseline, and visualizations.
- [ml-deploy-demo](https://github.com/Enes-arch-hub/ml-deploy-demo) — Small model served with FastAPI and Docker, with a mobile client demo.

(If these repos don't exist yet, use these names as suggestions and replace links with your real project URLs.)

## 🧭 How I learn / my study routine
- Weekly: 1 practical mini-project (Flutter UI or a small ML pipeline) + 1 reading/video deep dive.
- I keep short notebooks for every experiment and write brief READMEs to document findings.
- I prefer hands-on debugging: profiling Flutter UIs and running ablation studies on models.

## 📚 Resources I use
- Flutter docs & cookbook, Ray Wenderlich tutorials
- Kaggle kernels, "Hands-On Machine Learning" / Coursera ML specializations
- TF Lite guides for on-device inference

Quick tips:
- Create a repo named exactly: Enes-arch-hub (make it public) and paste this README.md to make it your profile README.
- Pin 3–6 repos (choose the best Flutter apps, notebooks, and experiments).
- Add screenshots/gifs to project READMEs — they grab attention faster than long text.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to open an issue on any of my repos or say hi 👋
